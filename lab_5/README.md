# Lab: 5
## K-means Clustering - From Scratch Implementation in Python

<p> <b> Note: </b> In this lab you'll are not allowed to use any external library for the K-Means algorithm. However you may use libraries such as Numpy or Matplotlib for array handling and visualisation </p>

## Lab Tasks: 

### Create a function named *kmeans* with the following details:
- the function should accept a matrix of data points, number os clusters and the number of iterations
- should compute the cluster centers (centroids) 
- for distance measurement use the Euclidean distance
- should keep track of the data points that belong to a certain cluster
- return centroids along with the points that belong to them (use Dictionary)

### For data point generate random data in two-dimensional space betweek -5 and 10
> see numpy library for that

### Plot the data points as cluster using Matplotlib

### **Note:** 
- submit a code script with the code for k-means and visualisation
- you will be marked on code organisation that includes naming conventions and best coding practices
- use appropriate data structures, such as lists, dictionaries etc. 
- use decent comments to elaborate a key steps in the algorithm
