"""
Lab: 1
Task: A

Your task is to implement a basic Queue in python in an OOP fashion.
Like stack, queue is a linear data structure that stores items in First In First Out (FIFO) manner. With a queue the least recently added item is removed first. A good example of queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first.

You Queue should have the following functions working for it:
    -> Enqueue(item): Adds an item to the queue.
    -> Dequeue(): Removes an item form the queue. The items are popped in the same order in whcih they are pushed
    -> Front(): Get the fron item from queue.
    -> Rear(): Get the last item from the queue.

Fill in the boiler plate class in this file.
You may create helper function to assist you for this task.

(NOTE: you are not allowed to to use libraries for this Task)
